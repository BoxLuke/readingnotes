Good Day, I'm Luke. This is my very first time using GitHub. 
### Hashtags as Headings? 
I just learned using hashtags can denote the heading. 
I believe growth mindset not allowing problems to stop learning. 
## 3 Reminders for a growth mindset. 

1 - Success is a journey. Everyone once had to learn. Instead of I ~~can't~~, think I will try. 

2 - **A challenge is an _oppertunity_ to learn.** 

3 - Effort is a chance to improve. 

<sub> Remember, If it were easy, everyone would do it. </sub>
